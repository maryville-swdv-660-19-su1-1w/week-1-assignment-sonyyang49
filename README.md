# SWDV 660 Applied DevOps Week 1 Assignment
Developed by:  Sony Yang

## Requirement:
Compatible only on Windows PC.  

## Executable File: DiceApp
Using pyinstaller, I compiled a working app that works only on the Windows platform.  

## Packages and Dependencies
I used Random as a random integer generator and Tkinter for GUI.  

## What the app does
When users open the executable file, they will see a Windows with two buttons.  "Roll" or "Exit".  

By clicking "Roll", the user will see a random integer between 1-6 displayed on the window.  They can continue to click the "Roll" button to get a new integer.  

If user clicks "Exit", the program will close.  


## Using App from Repository

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```
